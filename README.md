# React Frontend Project – E-Commerce

##  Overview

This is a responsive and modular e-commerce frontend application built using **React.js**. The project layout was meticulously designed based on a Figma template and implemented as part of a collaborative development effort.

📌 **Figma Design Reference**:
[Elegant E-Commerce UI Design – Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/2E8bDo06XE9uHLIcjiN8U0/3legant-E-Commerce-UI-Design-Template--Community-?node-id=3-674&p=f&t=GDPPDyxwIIDWdgP2-0)

## Team Responsibilities

Each team member contributed by:

* Creating fully **responsive** pages and components.
* Implementing designs consistent with the **Figma layout**.
* Using shared components like **Navbar** and **Footer**.
* Writing modular and **clean code** using functional components.
